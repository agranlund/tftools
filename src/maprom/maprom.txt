maprom.prg
Run as one of the first items in the AUTO folder.

Registers fastram, FRB and MMU as needed depending on TOS version.
Can map rom, and parts of ram to fastram.
Some features may depend on specific card/firmwares.

It will create a settings file on first launch with sensible defaults.
If you launch the program from the AUTO folder then you will
find TF536.INF in the root of the boot drive.
Otherwise it should end up right next to where the program is.


Settings:

PMMU: <bool>        Allow / Disallow using the PMMU
                    Some features will not work with MMU disabled.
                    This option is useful when you want to use
                    memory protection in MiNT.

detect: <bool>      Enable card detection for card-specific features

romL1: <bool>       Enable L1 cache for ROM.
                    Disabling requires MMU

ramL1: <bool>       Enable L1 cache for ST-RAM.
                    Disabling requires MMU

romL2: <bool>       Puts entire ROM in fastram for fast access.
                    This is normally done using the MMU but some
                    cards may be able to do it in firmware.

zeroL2: <bool>      Puts zero page in fastram.
                    This is normally done using the MMU but some
                    cards may be able to do it in firmware.

ramL2: <bool>       Makes read access from ST-RAM very fast.
                    This feature requires firmware support
                    on the card.

fixSTGA: <bool>     Fix cache related STGA issues.
                    Requires MMU to cache inhibit $C00000-$DFFFFF

fixDMA: <int>       Fix cache related DMA issues.
                    0: off
                    1: normal (cache inhibit $0000-$7FFF)
                    2: full (additional fix for ST-RAM L2 cache)
