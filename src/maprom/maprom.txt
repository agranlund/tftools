maprom.prg / maprom_c.prg

These programs registers TT-RAM with the operating system.
Additionally they provide a speedup by placing the following in TT-RAM:
- ROM image (0xE00000 or 0xFC0000)
- System vectors + super stack ($0000-$0FFF)
- Some TOS system variables ($2000-7FFF, TOS 2.06 only)

maprom_c.prg works the same as maprom.prg but also allows L1 cache
to be enabled for ST-RAM as long as your accelerator supports it.
This can speed up games that aren't possible to run from fastram but it
may cause incompatibility with TOS206 and caches enabled.

Stick in in your AUTO folder, preferably as the very first item, and you
will have a faster TOS experience and the ability for applications to
run from FastRAM, regardless if you are using EmuTOS or TOS 2.06
