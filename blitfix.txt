blitfix attempts to fix various blitter related issues on
machines which have both TT-RAM and Blitter.

It does nothing unless TT-RAM is available, the CPU is 32bit, and
a blitter is actually installed - so it's safe to leave the program
in the AUTO folder even if you toggle off the accelerator,
remove the blitter, etc.

This program should run after MAPROM.PRG.

* Mainly for TOS 2.06/3.06 & EmuTOS. Limited use for other versions.


NVDI / WARP9:
  - These programs are tricked into thinking that the blitter is not
    present, thus preventing them from crashing.

Atari TOS 2.06 / 3.06:
  - VDI/LineA blitter routines are patched to be able to fall back
    to software routines when addresses are outside of blitter range.

EmuTOS:
  - Allows programs running in ST-RAM to know the real status
    of the blitter.
    (EmuTOS will by default hide the blitter if TT-RAM is present)

  - If you have a custom build of EmuTOS which is not lying about
    the blitter, then this program does nothing.


Other TOS versions:
  - TOS is made to believe the blitter is not present
  - Only programs running in ST-RAM will be told that blitter is present
